## Abstract
This project aims to predict and classify heart disease using machine learning. We implemented six machine learning algorithms in both Python and RapidMiner software to assess predictive performance and determine the best model for heart disease classification based on a given dataset.

## Approach

To classify and predict heart disease, we utilized the following six models:

1. **Logistic Regression** (Python)
2. **Support Vector Machine** (Python)
3. **Gaussian Naive Bayes** (Python)
4. **Decision Tree** (Python)
5. **K-Nearest Neighbor** (Python)
6. **Neural Networks** (RapidMiner)

We divided the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80:20 ratio. The training set (80%) is used to train the models, tuning parameters to minimize error. The test set (20%) evaluates the performance of each model.
